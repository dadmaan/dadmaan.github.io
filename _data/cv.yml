    - title: Thesis Summary.
      contents:
        - In this work, I leveraged neural networks to address Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks and the algorithmic composition of music. The multifaceted project saw the development of a Python-based guitar tuner, utilizing time-frequency representation inputs processed through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify chords accurately. I further harnessed the capabilities of CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to undertake music classification tasks, distinguishing between different genres and instrument classifications. A notable achievement was designing an AI-driven system capable of composing structured Jazz music, drawing inspiration from natural language models, and utilizing a character-based approach.
