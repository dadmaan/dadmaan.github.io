Hello!

I am a curious individual grounded in both the academic and professional realms of computer science and technology. Over the years, I have fostered an understanding of various programming languages, software methodologies, and system logic. My roles have varied, from guiding design teams and web development projects to applying AI in intelligent systems and exploring the intersection of music and art with artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. 

Building on this foundation, I have embarked on exciting collaborations with artists to delve deeper into the application of generative AI. Leveraging state-of-the-art tools like StableDiffusion models and the StyleGAN family, we created various concepts by blending technology and art. These efforts have been playgrounds for experimentation and creation to disclose the transformative potential of AI in augmenting artistic expression.

Now, in a natural progression of my journey, I am pursuing my PhD, where I have the opportunity to delve into the world of symbolic music generation through the lens of multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning. This phase is a humble yet spirited exploration into technology and creativity through generative AI. The main objective is to develop a collaborative learning method that users can incorporate into systems learning through an interactive interface. The idea is to guide the system learning toward user preferences. It's an effort to understand how AI can better resonate with individual musical tastes and respond in a meaningful way.

I am open to exploring new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions related to the generative AI, music generation tasks, and human computer interaction. If you are a interested in working with me or learning more about my research, feel free to reach out. I am  also open to supervising passionate and dedicated students.
