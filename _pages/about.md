Hello!

I'm at the intersection of technology and creativity, immersing myself in both computer science's academic and professional spheres.

Currently, I am on a PhD journey, focusing on symbolic music generation, using multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning. My goal is simple yet profound: to develop an AI system that resonates with individual musical tastes, forming a collaborative and interactive connection with users.

Whether it's delving into generative AI, engaging in music generation tasks, or discussing human-computer interaction, I'm open to collaborations and conversations that stimulate learning and innovation.

Feel free to reach out if you're curious to learn more or interested in working together.
