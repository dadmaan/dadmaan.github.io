## Education
{:data-toc-text="Education"}
<ul>
    <li>
    <span class="badge-toc">July 2021 - Present</span>
    <p><strong>PhD Candidate in Computer Science</strong> - UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Narvik, Norway</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My PhD research explores the intersection of multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning in the context of symbolic music generation. The primary goal is to design a collaborative learning environment facilitated through a user-centric interface. This project strives to enable artificial intelligence systems to understand better and adapt to individual user preferences. It's an experience towards harmonizing technology with human insight where AI can create personalized and interesting musical compositions.</li>
        </ul>

    <span class="badge-toc">Aug 2018 - June 2020</span>
    <p><strong>M.S Computer Science</strong> - UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Narvik, Norway</p>
        <ul>
            <li>During this study, I cultivated a robust foundation in technical programming and the development of advanced software and learning systems. I acquired skills in cutting-edge areas such as artificial intelligence, geometric modeling, virtual reality, and computer graphics, as well as in object-oriented in C++, Python, and GPU programming.</li>
            <li>I benefitted from high-quality lab facilities and active AI and applied mathematics research groups, topping a comprehensive diploma thesis project. This rigorous academic preparation, grounded in theoretical knowledge and practical application, has equipped me to excel in technical and managerial roles in various technologically advanced industries and academic settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Thesis Summary:</strong> During my thesis, I leveraged neural networks to address Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks and the algorithmic composition of music. The multifaceted project saw the development of a Python-based guitar tuner, utilizing time-frequency representation inputs processed through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify chords accurately. I further harnessed the capabilities of CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to undertake music classification tasks, distinguishing between different genres and instrument classifications. A notable achievement was designing an AI-driven system capable of composing structured Jazz music, drawing inspiration from natural language models, and utilizing a character-based approach.

    <span class="badge-toc">Oct 2012 - May 2017</span>
    <p><strong>B.S Software Engineering</strong> - Azad University of Tehran North, Tehran, Iran</p>
        <ul>
            <li>During my undergraduate studies in software engineering, I had the opportunity to explore a broad array of concepts and methodologies central to the field. I became acquainted with artificial intelligence and system logics, delving into different software methodologies that are pivotal in the industry today.</li>
            <li>My coursework involved practical experience in programming languages like C# and C++, as well as working with Linux systems, which gave me a solid foundation in the technical aspects of software development. The program also included syudies such as state machines, automata, databases, interface design, statistical analysis, and mathematical engineering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Thesis Summary:</strong> During my bachelor thesis project, I focused on improving the user interactivity and convenience of e-commerce platforms. I delved deep into understanding and applying UID and UXD principles to cater to a wide range of users. My approach involved utilizing AppML to streamline the management of HTML data, effectively reducing code complexity by facilitating the transfer of data from .JSON files. Additionally, I employed Sass and Bootstrap API to enhance template efficiency. This project allowed me to integrate various tools and strategies, working towards a more user-friendly and efficient e-commerce platform.
